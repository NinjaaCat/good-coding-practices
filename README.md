Good coding practices
=====================

Good coding practices for students in computational scientific disciplines.

The wiki itself is here: https://github.com/mikpanko/good-coding-practices/wiki.

The repository consists of the scientific code examples from other scientists. Feel free to browse, download, and play with these scripts. They are here to demonstrate different coding styles. If you want to contribute your own code, fork the repository, add a folder with your code, give it your name ("first_last"), and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Have fun coding!
